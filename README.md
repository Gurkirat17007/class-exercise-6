One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:

>I’m exasperated by this push to require JS / get rid of CSS…but I’m angry at the conferences promoting these ideas: @FronteersConf @CSSConf

On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

>Personally, I’ve found this method remarkably effective for building performant progressive web apps. I find that, by starting with a baseline of a low-end Android phone, throttled to 2G or 3G, and using that as my primary test device, I can build a web application that works quite well on a variety of hardware, browser, and network conditions. Optimizing for such devices tends to naturally lead to a heavily client-side approach, because by avoiding network round-trips the UI interactions become snappy and app-like. And thanks to advances in JavaScript frameworks, it’s easier than ever to move UI logic from the client to the server (using Node.js), in order to achieve a fast initial render.


It is very important to use javascript and css to make the website good looking.
